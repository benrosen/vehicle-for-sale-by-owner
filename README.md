A solo roleplaying game about selling your mech.

You are a mech pilot. The time has come to sell your old ride.

Use this guide to help you write a “classifieds ad” that showcases your mech to potential buyers.

### BEFORE YOU PLAY, YOU NEED:

- [x] This rule sheet
- [ ] 1 six-sided die (D6)
- [ ] 1 pack of standard playing cards
- [ ] Pen and paper

### BEFORE YOUR FIRST TURN:
1. Shuffle the deck
2. Roll the D6 and draw that many cards (you can put the rest of the cards off to the side; you won’t need them)

### EACH TURN:
1. Play a card from your hand
2. Use the [SYSTEMS](#systems) table and the [ASPECTS](#aspects) table to derive a prompt (e.g. the prompt for the five of hearts would be “weapons anecdote”. Three of diamonds would be “AI quirk”. The ace of spades would be “power specifications”.)
3. Roll the D6 and use the [APPEAL](#appeal) table to determine how appealing buyers will find this aspect of your mech's system.
4. Write a sentence or two (or three…) about this aspect of your mech's system, keeping in mind its appeal to your potential buyers.

### AFTER PLAYING ALL YOUR CARDS:
1. Double-check your ad for spelling and grammatical errors
2. Choose a fair listing price for your mech
3. Post your ad somewhere potential buyers are likely to see it
